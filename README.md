CFD Analysis of Flow Meters and Pipe Fittings
FOSSEE Semester Internship | IIT Bombay

This project was completed during a semester-long internship at IIT Bombay under the FOSSEE program. The work involves the numerical simulation and turbulence modeling of incompressible flows through various engineering components using CFD3. The primary goal was to study flow features and determine performance parameters such as the Coefficient of Discharge ($C_d$) and Minor Loss Factors ($K$).\\
Key Case Studies
Orifice Meter: Analysis of turbulent flow features and determination of $C_d$.
Sudden Expansion & Contraction: Investigation of minor loss factors and flow separation.
Pipe Bends: Comparative study of loss factors between Smooth and Sharp (90° Elbow) bends.
